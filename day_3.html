						##  8. A simulation modeller as a software developer
						### a workflow
						
						---
						## 8.1 The "big picture"
						### Why?

						* **Reproducible:** anyone (including your future self) can run it and obtain the same results.
						* **Transparent:** the model’s assumptions, mechanisms, and implementation are easy to inspect.
						* **Collaborative:** colleagues can contribute, review, or reuse your code and data.
						* **Extensible:** improvements, corrections, or new experiments can be added without breaking the project.
						* **Reusable:** others can build on your work.

						---
						## 8.1 The "big picture"
						### Modeller as a software developer

						1. **Conceptual model**
						2. **Implementation or "implemented model"** ("coding sessions").  
						3. **Version control** ("git commits").
						4. **Experimentation** ("simulations")
						5. **Analysis**  
						6. **Publication**

						### Example of a workflow in time
						```
💡📝 First conceptual model with enough definitions (variables, parameters, agents, functions)
        ↓
🧱 First programming session creating a few model elements (not runnable)
        ↓
🔄 Commit changes: "add netlogo file"
        ↓
🔁📝 Rethinking a few definitions
        ↓
🧱 Second programming session updating the model with new definitions (not runnable)
        ↓
🔄 Commit changes: "update netlogo file"
        ↓
🧱 Third programming session creating a minimal set of procedures for initialisation (runnable)
        ↓
🔄 Commit changes: "update netlogo file"
        ↓
...
        ↓
🧪📊 Run a few simulations and observe the model dynamics (also output variables)
        ↓
🔁🧱 Refine a model procedure, not reasonably behaving as intended
        ↓
...
        ↓

						* [ ] Installed **Git** (and **GitHub Desktop**) on your computer.  
						* [ ] Installed **NetLogo**, and **R** (and **RStudio**).

						## 9.1 Version control and Git
						### What is version control?
						- A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
						- Compare, revert, recover
						- Collaborative (who, what, when, why)
						- Centralised vs. distributed (e.g. **Git**)

						## 9.2 Git terminology
						### Repository
						- A collection of files and folders associated with a project.
						- Contains the entire history of the project.
						- Can be local to a folder on your computer, or remote (e.g. on GitHub).
						
						### Initialise
						- Create a new, empty repository.
						- Can be done locally or remotely.
						- Local repositories can be pushed to a remote repository.
						- Remote repositories can be cloned to a local repository.
						- Local repositories can be synced with a remote repository.

						---
						## 9.2 Git terminology
						### Add/Stage
						- Add changes to the staging area.
						- The staging area is a temporary area where changes are stored before they are committed to the repository.
						- Changes can be added to the staging area one at a time, or all at once.
						- Changes can be removed from the staging area before they are committed.

						### Commit
						- A snapshot of the files in a repository at a particular point in time.
						- A commit has a unique ID, a timestamp, and a message describing the changes made in that commit.
						- Commits are made to a repository and can be viewed, compared, and reverted.

						---
						## 9.2 Git terminology
						### Push
						- Send changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
						- Changes are sent as commits.
						- Changes can be pushed to a remote repository from a local repository.
						- Changes can be pushed to a remote repository from a remote repository.
						
						### Pull
						- Get changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
						- Changes are received as commits.
						- Changes can be pulled from a remote repository to a local repository.
						- Changes can be pulled from a remote repository to a remote repository.

						---
						## 9.2 Git terminology
						### Branch
						- A parallel version of a repository.
						- Used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas.
						- Can be merged back into the main branch (e.g. `main` or `master`).
						- Can be deleted after they are merged.

						### Merge
						- Combine changes from one branch into another.

						---
						### GitHub terminology

						### Clone
						- Create a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
						- The clone will contain the entire history of the project.
						- The clone will be a local repository, linked to the remote repository.
						
						### Fork
						- Create a copy of a remote repository on a remote server.
						- The fork will contain the entire history of the project.
						- The fork will be a remote repository, linked to the original remote repository.

						---
						### GitHub terminology
						### Pull request
						- A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
						- A way to propose changes to a project.
						- A way to discuss changes with other developers.
						- A way to review, text, and approve changes before they are merged.

						# 11 Introduction to NetLogo
						## 11.1 Preparation

						Download or 'clone' the contents of [this repository](https://github.com/CoDArchLab-ABM/course-guide/) into a local folder. Select "Code" in the top right of the repository page in GitHub, and choose one of the options given.  

						![Code](assets/images/Code-button.png)
						
						Download and install NetLogo latest version (only if working in your own computer).
						
						<small>Currently, it is NetLogo 7.0.2 (file extension .nlogox), but consider that lab computers might have a previous version (file extension .nlogo). The operating system-specific installation files are found here: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml</small>
