## 19 Implementing mechanisms
### First-tier dynamics

- Settlements produce goods, and have it decay over time.  
- Traders choose destination✅, load, move✅ and unload goods.  
- Settlements' size increase with goods and decay otherwise.  
- Settlements get more or less traders depending on their size.

## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop 🤔
### Trade and economic size

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself:

- Traders load and unload goods at the base and destination settlements (use a variable: `cargoValue`) 
- Settlements increase their size with goods coming by trade  
- Reorganise the behaviour of traders inside a `update-traders` procedure  
- Settlement size decay over time, down to a minimum size of 1 (use a parameter: `settlementSizeDecayRate`)  

Things to consider:
- When should traders load and unload goods?
- How to decrease settlement size over time?

---
## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop - Solution
### Updating traders

```NetLogo
to update-traders

  let tradersInBase traders with [is-in-base]
  let tradersInDestination traders with [is-in-destination]

  ; UPDATE LAST POSITION
  ask traders
  [
    ; update lastPosition if in a patch center
    if ((xcor = [pxcor] of patch-here) and (ycor = [pycor] of patch-here))
    [
      set lastPosition patch-here
    ]
  ]

  ; UNLOAD
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination) with [cargoValue > 0]
  [
    ; unload cargo (changes sizeLevel)
    unload-cargo
    ; load cargo (changes stock)
    load-cargo
  ]

  ; CHOOSE DESTINATION
  ask tradersInBase
  [
    ; update the destination whenever in the base settlement and there is cargo to transport
    choose-destination
  ]

  ; FIND DIRECTION in route
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination)
  [
    find-direction
  ]

  ; MOVE towards the next position in the route
  ask traders
  [
    ; move following the route when there is cargo to transport
    move-to-destination
  ]

end

to choose-destination ; ego = trader

  let thisTrader self

  ; get routes connecting the base settlement
  let routesFromBase get-routes-to-settlement [base] of thisTrader

  ; order these routes by benefit/cost ratio
  set routesFromBase sort-by [ [?1 ?2] -> benefit-cost-of-route ?1 > benefit-cost-of-route ?2 ] routesFromBase

  ; print the options available
;  foreach routesFromBase
;  [
;    print "==============================================================="
;    print "route between:"
;    print [who] of get-origin-and-destination ?
;    print "has the benefit-cost ratio of:"
;    print benefit-cost-of-route ?
;  ]
;  print "-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x"

  ; select the one with higher benefit/cost ratio
  set route first routesFromBase

  ; get the settlement of destination
  set destination one-of (get-origin-and-destination route) with [who != [who] of ([base] of thisTrader)]

end

to find-direction ; ego = trader

  ; find where in the route list is the trader
  let currentPosition position lastPosition route

  ; set direction if in a settlement
  ifelse (currentPosition = 0) ; in the first extreme of the route list
  [
    ; move in the route list towards larger index numbers
    set direction 1
  ]
  [
    if (currentPosition = (length route - 1)) ; in the last extreme of the route list
    [
      ; move in the route list towards smaller index numbers
      set direction -1
    ]
  ]
  ; else the trader is in route to either the base or the destination

end

to move-to-destination ; ego = trader

  ; find where in the route list is the trader
  let currentPosition position lastPosition route

  ; move through the route following direction
  let targetPatch item (currentPosition + direction) route
  ;move-to targetPatch ; constant travel time (1 patch per tick)
  facexy ([pxcor] of targetPatch) ([pycor] of targetPatch)
  forward min (
    list
    (1 / [pathCost] of patch-here) ; the maximum distance in a tick in the current patch
    (distancexy ([pxcor] of targetPatch) ([pycor] of targetPatch)) ; the distance to the target patch
    )

end

to-report is-in-base ; ego = trader

  report (xcor = [xcor] of base) and (ycor = [ycor] of base) ; if the trader arrived at the center of the base patch

end

to-report is-in-destination ; ego = trader

  report (xcor = [xcor] of destination) and (ycor = [ycor] of destination) ; if the trader arrived at the center of the destination patch

end
```

## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop - Solution
### Unload and load cargo
```NetLogo
traders-own [ base route destination direction lastPosition cargoValue ]

...

to unload-cargo ; ego = trader

  let thisTrader self
  let settlementHere one-of settlements-here

  ; unload cargo
  ask settlementHere [ add-trade-effect [cargoValue] of thisTrader ]

end

to load-cargo ; ego = trader

  let settlementHere one-of settlements-here

  ; load cargo
  set cargoValue [sizeLevel] of settlementHere

end

to add-trade-effect [ value ] ; ego = settlement

  set sizeLevel sizeLevel + value

end

```

---
## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop - Solution
### Decreasing settlement size over time

```NetLogo
to go

  tick

  update-traders

  ; the size of settlements decays with a constant rate, up to 1 (minimum)
  ask settlements
  [
    set sizeLevel max (list 1 (sizeLevel * (1 - (settlementSizeDecayRate / 100)) ) )
  ]

  update-display

end
```

<small>Remember to add the `settlementSizeDecayRate` slider to the interface.</small>

<small>Is there something wrong with the model behaviour?</small>

---
## 19.4 Detecting and correcting mistakes 🤔

Use `inspect` and printing commands to debug the model.

Can you tell what is wrong with the model behaviour?

<small>Hint: check the behaviour of traders when unloading and loading cargo.</small>

---
## 19.4 Detecting and correcting mistakes - Solution

Traders will never load cargo at the start of our simulation!

Reorganise `update-traders`:


```NetLogo
to update-traders
  
  ...

  ; UNLOAD
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination) with [cargoValue > 0]
  [
    ; unload cargo (changes sizeLevel)
    unload-cargo
  ]

  ; LOAD
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination)
  [
    ; load cargo (changes stock)
    load-cargo
  ]

  ...

end
```

<small>Traders are now loading cargo at the start of the simulation and trade hubs eventually emerge.</small>

---
## 19.5 Implementing two feedback loops 🤔
### Trade and production, and trade and number of traders

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself:
- Settlements produce goods every tick in proportion to their size (use a parameter: `productionRate`; use variables: `sizeLevel`, `stock`)
- The number of traders per settlement increases with settlement size (use variables: `currentNumberOfTraders`, `potentialNumberOfTraders`)
- Reorganise the behaviour of settlements inside a `update-settlements` procedure

Things to consider:
- How to increase the stock of settlements over time?
- How to calculate the potential number of traders?
- How to create new traders when needed? How to remove them?

### Updating settlements and number of traders

```NetLogo

    set potentialNumberOfTraders get-potential-number-of-traders

    hatch-traders potentialNumberOfTraders ; use the sizeLevel variable as the number of traders based in the settlement
    [
      setup-trader thisSettlement

    set currentNumberOfTraders get-current-number-of-traders
  ]

end

to setup-trader [ baseSettlement ]

  set base baseSettlement

    )

end

to-report get-current-number-of-traders ; ego = settlement

  let thisSettlement self
  report count traders with [isActivated and base = thisSettlement ]

end

```

<small>Add plot to visualise the number of traders, using the following: `plot count traders with [isActivated]`</small>

## 19.5 Implementing two feedback loops - Solution
### Goods, stock and production

```NetLogo

  stock

...

to create-coastal-settlements

  ; consider only coastal patches
  let coastalPatches patches with [(isLand = true) and (any? neighbors with [isLand = false])]

  repeat numberOfSettlements
  [
    ; ask a random coastal patch without a settlement already
    ask one-of coastalPatches with [not any? settlements-here]
    [
      sprout-settlements 1 ; creates one "turtle" of breed settlements

end

...

to load-cargo ; ego = trader

  let settlementHere one-of settlements-here

  ; load cargo
  set cargoValue [stock] of settlementHere
  ask settlementHere [ set stock 0 ] ; empty the settlement stock

end

...

to update-settlements

  ask settlements
  [
    let thisSettlement self

    ; the sizeLevel of settlements decays with a constant rate, up to 1 (minimum)
    set sizeLevel max (list 1 (sizeLevel * (1 - (settlementSizeDecayRate / 100)) ) )
    ; production in stock also decays with a constant rate
    set stock stock * (1 - (stockDecayRate / 100))
    ; prodution is generated in proportion to sizeLevel, following a constant rate
    set stock stock + sizeLevel * (productionRate / 100)

    ; determine the current and potential number of traders
    set currentNumberOfTraders get-current-number-of-traders
    set potentialNumberOfTraders get-potential-number-of-traders

    ; conditions favors the creation of new traders
    if (random-float 1 > currentNumberOfTraders / potentialNumberOfTraders )
    [

<small>Remenber to create `productionRate`, `stockDecayRate`, `settlementSizeDecayRate` as parameters in the interface.</small>

## 19.6 Detecting hidden "magic numbers"

Economical size is translated directly into the number of traders.

```NetLogo
to-report get-potential-number-of-traders ; ego = settlement

  report (
    1 +
    (sizeLevel - 1) 🪄
    )

end
```

Let's introduce a parameter to control this relationship!

---
## 19.6 Detecting hidden "magic numbers" - Solution

```NetLogo
settlements-own
[
  ...

  frequencyOverQuality
]

...

to create-coastal-settlements

  ; consider only coastal patches
  let coastalPatches patches with [(isLand = true) and (any? neighbors with [isLand = false])]

  repeat numberOfSettlements
  [
    ; ask a random coastal patch without a settlement already
    ask one-of coastalPatches with [not any? settlements-here]
    [
      sprout-settlements 1 ; creates one "turtle" of breed settlements
      [
        set sizeLevel 1 ; the size level is initiated at minimum (i.e., 1)
        set stock 0
        set frequencyOverQuality random-float 1
        set shape "circle 2"
      ]
      ; replace the land path cost with the port pathCost
      set pathCost relativePathCostInPort
      ; exclude this patch from the pool of coastal patches
      set coastalPatches other coastalPatches
    ]
  ]

end

to-report get-potential-number-of-traders ; ego = settlement

  report (
    1 +
    (sizeLevel - 1) * frequencyOverQuality
    )

end
```

<small>The new parameter reads as "how much the frequency of trade is prioritised over the quality of the cargo".</small>
