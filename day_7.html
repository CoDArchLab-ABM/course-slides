						# 18 Programming agent AI

						---
						## 18.1 Modelling behaviour

						Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans (or anything we consider intelligent).

						<img src="https://wholebrainteaching-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rule-2-Harry.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=1200&ssl=1" alt="Behavior rule card from school" width="200">

						In the context of ABM, AI refers to the rules and decision-making processes that govern the behaviour of individual agents within the model.

						---
						## 18.1 Modelling behaviour
						
						For our model, based on the conceptual model, we will implement simple behaviour for two agent types:

						- `settlements`: 
							- produce goods according to their size and a productivity term. 
							- create or destroy traders according to their current size. 
						- `traders`: 
							- take some goods from their base and deliver them to another settlement, 
							- which is chosen based on the size of other settlements and the distance between these and the base settlement.
							- Traders will then return with goods from that settlement back to the base and restart the cycle.
						
						<small>Implementing these behavioural rules will take us from step 6 to 9.</small>
						---
						## 18.2 Implementing path finding

						Start from the most fundamental: **movement of traders between settlements**.
						
						We want a proper *path-finding algorithm* that will allow traders to navigate the pond avoiding land patches (least-cost path).

						We will use the [A* (A-star) algorithm in NetLogo User Community Models](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Astardemo1).

						<img src="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/community/Astardemo1.png" alt="A* path-finding algorithm" width="200">

						<small>Try also the simpler implementation using Euclidean distance and `links` in the [PondTrade_step07_agent AI v2_links.nlogo](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/PondTrade/blob/master/PondTrade_step07_agent%20AI%20v2_links.nlogo) file.</small>

						## 18.2 Implementing path finding
						### Assigning path costs 🤔

						Once the algorithm is clear, we need to assign path costs to patches.

						Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself:

						- Each patch has a `pathCost` variable (already defined)
						- Land patches have a high `pathCost` (arbitrary, e.g. 1000)
						- Water patches have a low `pathCost` (the baseline, i.e. 1)

						When and where should this be done?
						Do we need to do it every time we run the search?
						What value should be a parameter (slider) in the interface?

						(EXTRA CHALLENGE: further differentiate the path cost in settlements, i.e. cost to "port")
						---

						### Assigning path costs - Solution

            ```NetLogo
            to create-map

              ...

              assign-path-cost

              paint-patches

            end

            ...

            to assign-path-cost

              ask patches
              [
                ifelse (isLand = false)
                [ set pathCost 1 ] ; arbitrary unit for now
                [ set pathCost relativePathCostInLand ] ; defined by parameter in relation to the cost of path in water (i.e., 1)
              ]

            end
            ```
						<small>Remember to create the `relativePathCostInLand` slider in the interface.</small>

						## 18.2 Implementing path finding
						### Assigning path costs - Solution (challenge)

            ```NetLogo
            to create-coastal-settlements

              ; consider only coastal patches
              let coastalPatches patches with [(isLand = true) and (any? neighbors with [isLand = false])]

              repeat numberOfSettlements
              [
                ; ask a random coastal patch without a settlement already
                ask one-of coastalPatches with [not any? settlements-here]
                [
                  sprout-settlements 1 ; creates one "turtle" of breed settlements
                  [
                    set sizeLevel 1 + random 10 ; sets a random arbitrary size level for the settlement (between 1 and 10)

                    ; give meaningful display proportional to size
                    set shape "circle 2"
                    set size 1 + sizeLevel / 3
                  ]
                  ; replace the land path cost with the port pathCost
                  set pathCost relativePathCostInPort
                  ; exclude this patch from the pool of coastal patches
                  set coastalPatches other coastalPatches
                ]
              ]

            end
            ```
						<small>Remember to create the `relativePathCostInPort` slider in the interface.</small>

						---
						## 18.3 Testing the A* path-finding

						- Uncomment the lines involving `set pcolor ...` in the `find-a-path` procedure to visualise the search process
						- reduce the simulation speed to see the search process
						- run `setup` (which now sets `pathCost`)
						- In the command center, run: 

            ```NetLogo
            show find-a-path (patch -30 -30) (patch 30 -30)
            ```

						<small>Try various coordinates to see how the search process work with different contexts.</small>

						## 18.4 Finding all routes

						Implement a new procedure `set-routes` that will:
						- be called during in `setup` after creating the settlements
						- will ask each settlement to find the best routes to every other settlements
						- will store the path in a new global variable `routes`

						This involves:
						- creating a new global variable `routes`
						- creating a new procedure `set-routes`
						- calling `set-routes` in `setup`
						- asking each settlement to find the best routes to every other settlements
						- storing the path in a new global variable `routes`

---
## 18.4 Adapting model schedule - Solution

```NetLogo

  ; set the random seed so we can reproduce the same experiment
  random-seed seed

  create-map

to set-routes

  set routes [] ; initialize/reset the routes as an empty list

  let settlementsWithoutRoutes settlements ; helper variable to keep track of which settlement already searched for routes

  ask settlements
  [
    let thisSettlement self

    ask other settlementsWithoutRoutes
    [
      let optimalRoute find-a-path ([patch-here] of thisSettlement) ([patch-here] of self) ; find the optimal route to this settlement
      set routes lput optimalRoute routes ; add the optimal route to the end of the routes list

      ; paint route patches in shades of red depending on route frequency
      foreach optimalRoute
      [ ?1 ->
        ask ?1
        [
          ifelse (pcolor = 106 or pcolor = 54) ; if its the first route crossing the patch
          [
            set pcolor 11
          ]
          [
            set pcolor min (list (pcolor + 1) (19)) ; sets a maximum at 19 (the brightest)

## 18.5 Decision making

Having implemented path-finding, we can now focus on the decision-making process of traders when choosing their destination settlement.

---
## 18.5 Decision making 🤔

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself (this is a hard one!):

- Create a new procedure `choose-destination` for the `trader` breed
- The procedure should:
  - calculate a "attractiveness" score for each settlement (excluding the base settlement)
  - choose the destination settlement with the best attractiveness score
- The attractiveness score should consider:
  - the size of the settlement (bigger is more attractive)
  - the distance (total path cost) from the base settlement (closer/less costly is more attractive)

---
## 18.5 Decision making - Solution

```NetLogo
traders-own [ base route destination direction lastPosition ]

...

to choose-destination ; ego = trader

  let thisTrader self

  ; get routes connecting the base settlement
  let routesFromBase get-routes-from-settlement [base] of thisTrader

  ; order these routes by benefit/cost ratio
  set routesFromBase sort-by [ [?1 ?2] -> benefit-cost-of-route ?1 > benefit-cost-of-route ?2 ] routesFromBase

  ; print the options available
;  foreach routesFromBase
;  [
;    print "==============================================================="
;    print "route between:"
;    print [who] of get-origin-and-destination ?
;    print "has the benefit-cost ratio of:"
;    print benefit-cost-of-route ?
;  ]
;  print "-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x"

  ; select the one with higher benefit/cost ratio
  set route first routesFromBase

  ; mark the most effective route
  foreach route
  [ ?1 ->
    ask ?1 [ set pcolor yellow ]
  ]

  ; get the settlement of destination
  set destination one-of (get-origin-and-destination route) with [who != [who] of ([base] of thisTrader)]

## 18.6 Movement

Once destination is decided, the trader needs to:

- move along the selected route until it reaches the destination settlement
- return to the origin settlement following the same route in reverse

---
## 18.6 Movement 🤔

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself (this is VERY hard!):
- Create a new procedure(s) for the `trader` breed
- The procedure should:
  - move the trader along the selected route towards the destination settlement (or back)
  - check if the trader is at the destination or base settlement and choose the right direction
  - check if in a patch centre (round coordinates) to move to the next patch in the route
  - move progressivelly towards the next patch in the route (not teleporting)
  - speed should be dependent on the pathCost of the patch-here

Things to consider:
- How to keep track of the direction of movement?
- How to keep track of the progress of movement?
- How to check if the trader is at the destination or base settlement?
- How to check if the trader is in a patch centre?
- How to move progressivelly one patch centre to another?
- How to make the speed dependent on the pathCost of the patch-here?

---
## 18.6 Movement - Solution

```NetLogo

  ]
  ; find where in the route list is the trader
  let currentPosition position lastPosition route

  [
    set direction 1 ; move in the route list towards larger index numbers

## 18.6 Movement - Solution (continued)

```NetLogo
to go

  ask traders
  [
    if (patch-here = [patch-here] of base) ; update the destination whenever in the base settlement

end
```

## 18.7 Enhancing visualisation

Colour the route patches depending on how many routes pass through them (done in `set-routes`)

```NetLogo
to setup

  clear-all
  reset-ticks

  ; set the random seed so we can reproduce the same experiment
  random-seed seed

  create-map

  create-coastal-settlements

  set-routes

  create-traders-per-settlement

  update-display

end

...

to update-display

  paint-routes
  paint-active-routes

  ; scale the size of settlements according to their dynamic free-scaled sizeLevel
  let maxSettlementSize max [sizeLevel] of settlements

  ask settlements
  [
    set hidden? not showSettlements
    set size 1 + (sizeLevel / maxSettlementSize) * 9
  ]

end

to paint-routes

  ; resets route patches to the terrain color
  foreach routes
  [ ?1 ->
    let aRoute ?1

    foreach aRoute
    [ ??1 ->
      ask ??1 [ paint-terrain ]
    ]
  ]

  ; paint route patches in shades of red depending on route frequency
  foreach routes
  [ ?1 ->
    let aRoute ?1

    foreach aRoute
    [ ??1 ->
      ask ??1
      [
        if (showRoutes)
        [
          ifelse (pcolor < 11 or pcolor > 19) ; if its the first route crossing the patch
          [
            set pcolor 11
          ]
          [
            set pcolor min (list (pcolor + 1) (19)) ; sets a maximum at 19 (the brightest)
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]

end

to paint-active-routes

  ask traders
  [
    foreach route
    [ ?1 ->
      ask ?1
      [
        ifelse (showActiveRoutes)
        [
          set pcolor yellow
        ]
        [
          if (not showRoutes) ; if not displaying all routes
          [
            ; resets to the patch terrain color
            paint-terrain
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]

end
```

<small>Remember to create the `showRoutes` and `showActiveRoutes` switches in the interface.</small>

## 18.8 Testing agent behaviour

Temporary hack: replace the code in `create-traders-per-settlement`:

```NetLogo
to create-traders-per-settlement

  ; For now, we create only one trader to better control its behaviour
  ask one-of settlements
  [
    let thisSettlement self

    hatch-traders 1
    [
      set base thisSettlement

      set shape "sailboat side" ; import this shape from the library (Tools > Shape editor > import from library)
      set color [color] of base
      set size 3
    ]
  ]

; the previous code for creating traders can be commented out
; by adding ';' at the beggining of each line, or
; by selecting several lines and either selecting 'Edit > Comment' or pressing 'ctrl + ;'.
;  ask settlements
;  [
;    let thisSettlement self ; to avoid the confusion of nested agent queries
;    hatch-traders round sizeLevel ; use the sizeLevel variable as the number of traders based in the settlement
;    [
;      set base thisSettlement
;
;      ; give meaningful display related to base
;      set shape "sailboat side" ; import this shape from the library (Tools > Shape editor > import from library)
;      set color [color] of base
;      set size 3
;
;      ; place it somewhere in the pond, randomly for now (if not, the command "hatch-breed" will place them in the same patch of the settlement)
;      move-to one-of patches with [isLand = false]
;    ]
;  ]

end
```

<small>Reduce `numberOfSettlements` (e.g. 10) and run `setup` and `run` (repeatedly) to observe the trader's behaviour.</small>

## 19 Implementing mechanisms
### First-tier dynamics

- Settlements produce goods, and have it decay over time.  
- Traders choose destination✅, load, move✅ and unload goods.  
- Settlements' size increase with goods and decay otherwise.  
- Settlements get more or less traders depending on their size.

## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop 🤔
### Trade and economic size

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself:

- Traders load and unload goods at the base and destination settlements (use a variable: `cargoValue`) 
- Settlements increase their size with goods coming by trade  
- Reorganise the behaviour of traders inside a `update-traders` procedure  
- Settlement size decay over time, down to a minimum size of 1 (use a parameter: `settlementSizeDecayRate`)  

Things to consider:
- When should traders load and unload goods?
- How to decrease settlement size over time?

## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop - Solution
### Unload and load cargo
```NetLogo

## 19.1 Implementing one feedback loop - Solution
### Decreasing settlement size over time

```NetLogo
to go

  tick

  update-traders

  ; the size of settlements decays with a constant rate, up to 1 (minimum)
  ask settlements
  [
    set sizeLevel max (list 1 (sizeLevel * (1 - (settlementSizeDecayRate / 100)) ) )

## 19.4 Detecting and correcting mistakes 🤔

Use `inspect` and printing commands to debug the model.

Can you tell what is wrong with the model behaviour?

<small>Hint: check the behaviour of traders when unloading and loading cargo.</small>

---
## 19.4 Detecting and correcting mistakes - Solution

Traders will never load cargo at the start of our simulation!

Reorganise `update-traders`:


```NetLogo
to update-traders
  
  ...

  ; UNLOAD
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination) with [cargoValue > 0]
  [
    ; unload cargo (changes sizeLevel)
    unload-cargo
  ]

  ; LOAD
  ask (turtle-set tradersInBase tradersInDestination)
  [
    ; load cargo (changes stock)
    load-cargo
  ]

  ...

end
```

<small>Traders are now loading cargo at the start of the simulation and trade hubs eventually emerge.</small>

---
## 19.5 Implementing two feedback loops 🤔
### Trade and production, and trade and number of traders

Before looking at the solution, try to write the code yourself:
- Settlements produce goods every tick in proportion to their size (use a parameter: `productionRate`; use variables: `sizeLevel`, `stock`)
- The number of traders per settlement increases with settlement size (use variables: `currentNumberOfTraders`, `potentialNumberOfTraders`)
- Reorganise the behaviour of settlements inside a `update-settlements` procedure

Things to consider:
- How to increase the stock of settlements over time?
- How to calculate the potential number of traders?
- How to create new traders when needed? How to remove them?

## 19.6 Detecting hidden "magic numbers"

Economical size is translated directly into the number of traders.

```NetLogo
to-report get-potential-number-of-traders ; ego = settlement

  report (
    1 +
    (sizeLevel - 1) 🪄
    )

end
```

Let's introduce a parameter to control this relationship!

---
## 19.6 Detecting hidden "magic numbers" - Solution

```NetLogo
settlements-own
[
  ...

  frequencyOverQuality
]

...

to create-coastal-settlements

  ; consider only coastal patches
  let coastalPatches patches with [(isLand = true) and (any? neighbors with [isLand = false])]

  repeat numberOfSettlements
  [
    ; ask a random coastal patch without a settlement already
    ask one-of coastalPatches with [not any? settlements-here]
    [
      sprout-settlements 1 ; creates one "turtle" of breed settlements
      [
        set sizeLevel 1 ; the size level is initiated at minimum (i.e., 1)
        set stock 0

  report (
    1 +
    (sizeLevel - 1) * frequencyOverQuality
    )

end
```

<small>The new parameter reads as "how much the frequency of trade is prioritised over the quality of the cargo".</small>
