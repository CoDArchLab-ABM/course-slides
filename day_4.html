						## 12.1 Console interaction
						
						* **Primitives**: basic building blocks
						* **Reporters**: return a value
						* **Commands**: do something

						<small>**Note**: "turtles" comes originally from the Logo programming language, which was designed for educational purposes in the 1960s and 1970s.</small></small>

						---
						## 12.2 Entities

						* **Turtles**: unique `who` numbers
						* **Patches**: unique `pxcor` and `pycor` coordinates
						* **Links**: between two `turtles`

						<small>**Note**: turtles and links can be created and destroyed, patches are always there.</small></small>

						---
						## 12.2 Entities

						```NetLogo
						turtle <WHO_NUMBER>
						patch <PXCOR> <PYCOR>
						link <WHO_NUMBER> <WHO_NUMBER>
						```

						---
						## 12.2 Entities

						```NetLogo
						breed [<BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL> <BREED_1_NAME_SINGULAR>]

						breed [<BREED_2_NAME_PLURAL> <BREED_2_NAME_SINGULAR>]
						```

						For example:

						```NetLogo
						breed [apples apple]

						breed [pears pear]
						```

						---
						## 12.2 Entities

						Then, we can refer to them individually as:
						```NetLogo
						<BREED_1_NAME_SINGULAR> <WHO_NUMBER>
						```
						```NetLogo
						pear 2
						```

						<small>**Note**: `who` numbers are unique across all turtles, including those of different breeds.</small>
						---
						## 12.2 Entities
						We can also refer to them collectively as:
						```NetLogo
						<BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>
						```
						```NetLogo
						pears
						```
						or randomly as:
						```NetLogo
						one-of apples
						one-of patches
						```
						<small>Note: `one-of` will return a random entity from the specified breed.</small>

						---
						## 12.3 Variables

						```NetLogo
						set <VARIABLE_NAME> <VALUE>
						```
						For example:
						```NetLogo
						set x 10
						set y 20
						```

						---
						## 12.3 Variables

						- **Number** (*e.g.*, `1`, `4.5`, `1E-6`)
						- **Boolean** (*i.e.*, `true`, `false`)
						- **String** (effectively text, but enclosed by quote marks: *e.g.*, `"1"`, `"my value"`)
						- `turtles`, `patches` (*i.e.*, NetLogo's computation entities)
						- **AgentSet** (a set of either `turtles` or `patches`)
						- **List** (a list enclosed in squared brakets with values of any kind separated by spaces: *e.g.*, `[ "1" 1 false my-agents-bunch ["my value" true 4.5] ]`)

						---
						## 12.3 Variables
						### Variable declaration

						```NetLogo
						globals [ <GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAME> ]
						
						turtles-own [ <TURTLE_VARIABLE_NAME> ]
						
						<BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>-own
						[ 
						  <BREED_1_VARIABLE_1_NAME>
						  <BREED_1_VARIABLE_2_NAME>
						]
						
						patches-own [ <PATCHES_VARIABLE_NAME> ]
						```

						---
						## 12.3 Variables
						### Variable declaration
						```NetLogo
						globals [ x y ]
						
						turtles-own [ weight ]
						
						apples-own [ redness ]
						```

						---
						## 12.3 Variables
						### Variable declaration (local)

						```NetLogo
						let <VARIABLE_NAME> <VALUE>
						```
						For example:
						```NetLogo
						let freshness 100
						```

						---
						## 12.3 Variables

						---
						## 12.4 Expressing equations
						
						* Use of common operators
						* Parentheses for grouping
						* Order of operations
						
						```NetLogo
						set myVariable (2 + 2) * 10 / ((2 + 2) * 10)
						```
						---
						## 12.4 Expressing equations
						
						NetLogo is very permissive with line breaks and whitespaces, and parentheses are not always strictly necessary.

						```NetLogo
						set myVariable (
						  (
						    (2 + 2) * 
						    10
						  ) / (
						    (2 + 2) * 
						    10
						  )
						)
						```

						However, it is good practice to keep different operations on different lines and use parentheses to avoid confusion.

						---
						## 12.4 Expressing equations
						### Using variables in equations

						Variables can be used in equations, as placeholders for values.
						
						```NetLogo
						set myVariable 2
						set myOtherVariable 10

						...

						let myTemporaryVariable 2 * myVariable * myOtherVariable

						set myVariable myTemporaryVariable / myTemporaryVariable
						```

						---
						## 12.5 Logical operators
						
						Equalities and inequalities, returning a **Boolean** value (`true` or `false`). 
						
						Operators:

						- `=`: "equals".  
						- `!=`: "not equal to".  
						- `>`: "greater than".  
						- `>=`: "greater than or equal to".  
						- `<`: "less than".  
						- `<=`: "less than or equal to".

						try:

						```NetLogo
						1 >= 0
						```

						or
					    
						```NetLogo
						100 >= 100 + 1
						```

						---
						## 12.5 Logical operators
						
						Cases when comparing non-numeric values:
						Booleans:
						```NetLogo
						true = false ; valid
						true >= false ; invalid
            			```
						Lists:
 						```NetLogo
						[1 2 3] = [ 1 ] ; valid
						[1 2 3] > [ 1 ] ; invalid
						```
						Strings:
						```NetLogo
						"apple" = "banana" ; valid
						"apple" >= "banana" ; valid
						```
						Entities:
						```NetLogo
						patch 0 0 != patch 1 1 ; valid
						turtle 0 < turtle 1 ; valid, but not recommended
						patch 0 0 > patch 1 1 ; valid, but not recommended
						```
						---
						## 12.6 Procedures

						An action that can be performed by a turtle, patch, or observer, declared with the keyword `to` and ended with the keyword `end`.

						```NetLogo
						to <PROCEDURE_NAME>
							<PROCEDURE_CODE>
						end
						```

						---
						## 12.6 Procedures

						```NetLogo
						to hello-world
							print "Hello World!"
						end
						```

						```
						observer> hello-world
						Hello World!
						```

						---
						## 12.6 Procedures

						Serve to group and enclose a sequence of commands that are semantically connected

						```NetLogo
						to set-it-and-show-me
							let thisVariableOfMine 42
							print thisVariableOfMine
						end
						```

						---
						## 12.6 Procedures

						Procedures can be called from within other procedures
						```NetLogo
						to <PROCEDURE NAME>
  							<PROCEDURE_1>
 							<PROCEDURE_2>
  							<PROCEDURE_3>
  							...
						end
						```
					
						---
						## 12.7 Logic bifurcations: `if` and `ifelse`

						```NetLogo
						if (<CONDITION_1_IS_TRUE>)
						[
							<DO_ACTION_A>
						]

						ifelse (<CONDITION_2_IS_TRUE>)
						[
							<DO_ACTION_B>
						]
						[
							<DO_ACTION_C>
						]
						```

						---
						## 12.8 Iterators (*loops*)

						```NetLogo
						while [<CONDITION_1_IS_TRUE>]
						[
							<DO_ACTION>
						]

						repeat <NUMBER_OF_TIMES>
						[
							<DO_ACTION>
						]
						```
						Try this out in the command center:
						```NetLogo
						let counter 0 repeat 10 [  set counter counter + 1 ] print counter
						```
						
						---
						## 12.8 Iterators (*loops*)

						A especial type of iterator abundantly used in NetLogo is `ask`. You can `ask` all or any subset of entities to perform specific commands by following the structure:

						```NetLogo
						ask <ENTITIES>
						[
							<DO_SOMETHING>
						]
						```
						Try this out in the command center:
						```NetLogo
						ask patches [ set pcolor blue ]
						```

						---
						## 12.9 Entities with variables, logic operations, and procedures

						```NetLogo
						ask <BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>
						[
							set <BREED_1_VARIABLE_2> <VALUE>
  							<PROCEDURE_1>
  							<PROCEDURE_2>
  							<PROCEDURE_3>
						]
						```

						---
						## 12.9 Entities with variables, logic operations, and procedures

						Scope is important!
						```NetLogo
						ask <BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>
						[
							print [<BREED_1_VARIABLE_2>] of <BREED_2_NAME_SINGULAR> <WHO_NUMBER>
						]
						```
						Filtering using logical operations:
						```NetLogo
						<TYPE_NAME_PLURAL> with [ <VARIABLE_NAME_1> > <THRESHOLD> ]
						```
						---
						## 12.9 Entities with variables, logic operations, and procedures

						Embedding `ask` within `ask`, and filtering oneself out using `other`:
						```NetLogo
						ask <BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>
						[
							ask other <BREED_1_NAME_PLURAL>
							[
								<PROCEDURE_1>
							]
						]
						```

						---
						## 12.9 Entities with variables, logic operations, and procedures

						All this can be combined to form quite complex rules of behaviour, yet keeping itself generally readable:

						```NetLogo
						to celebrate-birthday
							ask people
							[
								if (today = my-birthday)
								[
									ask other people with [presents > 0]
									[
										give-present
									]
								]
							]
						end
						```

						## 12.10 Grid (world)

						Interface > Settings > Grid

						<img src="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.3.1/docs/images/interface/settings.png" width="200">
						
						Default: 33x33 grid with the position (0,0) at the centre.
						
						Warning: often you will want to uncheck the 'wrap' options. To see the effect of this, try:
						```NetLogo
						ask patch -16 0 [ print distance patch 16 0 ]
						```

						---
						## 12.11 Commenting code

						```NetLogo
						<CODE>
						; <FREE_TEXT>
						<CODE>
						; or
						<CODE> ; <FREE_TEXT>
						```

						## 13.1 ABM beyond NetLogo

						**ABM is not equivalent to NetLogo** or any other software, it is a way of thinking about processes and systems.


						Tecnically, ABM can be implemented in any programming language, however it is often easier to use a dedicated software (with a graphical interface, a built-in language, etc.).

						## 13.5 What to take away

						* **NetLogo**: ideal for learning ABM concepts quickly, focusing on model logic rather than low-level programming.
						* **Other frameworks** offer greater flexibility, scalability, and integration with scientific workflows — but they require more programming experience and practice with the platform.

						learning about them is always a good idea!
